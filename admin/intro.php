<p><em>Ads EZ</em> is a clever program to serve your ads to multiple web sites. It can work as standalone web application or as a WordPress plugin. Using <em>Ads EZ</em>, you can centralize your banner ads in one location, and use simple shortcodes to place them on your blog pages, or generate invocation codes to place them on <em>any</em> other web sites or blogs. In the Pro version, you can even serve HTML ads with the same shortcode and invocation code mechanism.</p>
