<p>This feature is available in the Pro version of this program, which allows you to create new categories and edit their meta data in a neat interface. </p>
<p>In this lite version, you have three categories already defined for you. You can <a href="categories.php">view and edit</a> them according to your preference. If you need to define more than three categories, you will have to do direct database manipulation to add or delete categories. See the <code>categories</code> table in your database using a DB tool such as <b>phpMyAdmin</b>.</p>
