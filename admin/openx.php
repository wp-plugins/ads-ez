<p>Ads EZ is designed to be drop-in replacement for OpenX (now known as Revive), a comprehensive and heavy-weight ad server. OpenX has a steep learning curve, and a sluggish and confusing interface, which is a bit dated. It also has a complex ad serving mechanism with click and impression counting and caching that can put your server under enormous load.</p>
<p>Ads Ez, on the other hand, is extremely light-weight. It is meant for personal ad serving, with impression statistics. With a couple of <code>.htaccess</code> directives that you can generate on this page, it is possible to use Ads EZ as a direct replacement for your OpenX server with tremendous performance boost.</p>
<p>This feature is only available in the Pro version of this program, which allows you to generate and tweak your server directives in a neat interface. </p>
